        <p><b>Favorite food is one of the most beautiful things that all people love. Eating is not only something to satisfy hunger, but it is also a pleasure in life.<br>
             A smart person is one who enjoys eating.As for the person who eats food quickly and does not focus on his taste, he does not feel the pleasure of<br> eating.
              <i style="background-color:rgb(112, 245, 205)">As for the favorite food,there are some foods that most people prefer.Like meat, sea fish and some types of chicken.</i>
               There are foods<br>that are not preferred by many people, such as broccoli.
               But in the end we must thank God Almighty for all his blessings, and we must<br> remember those who suffer from wars and lack of food.
